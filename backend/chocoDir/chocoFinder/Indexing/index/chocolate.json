It is pleasurable enough to sip as an aperitif, but as the tingling heart of our truffles it seems to have achieved its true destiny, as it were, since it makes them into real champagne truffles \u2013 the marriage of two highly elegant worlds. The Blanc&Noir truffles are an adventure in taste: the glorious, rich fruitiness of the ganache mingles with the mild, wild pearls of the champagne, whose aromas resonate sometimes near, sometimes from afar. When the exuberant champagne celebration finally fades away, the taste of the chocolate, which reveals itself in the blanc as milky-smooth and the noir as intensely bittersweet, lingers powerfully for a few fleeting moments as an exquisite memory on your tongue. And then, to the great joy of the senses, it starts all over again with the next truffle.",
